For classification, it identifies the k nearest training points to a new input using a distance metric, such as Euclidean distance, and assigns the class that appears most frequently among these neighbors. The choice of k and the distance metric significantly impacts performance, with small k values being sensitive to noise and large k values potentially overlooking local patterns. Feature scaling and selection are crucial to ensure fair distance calculations.']","The k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithm works for classification by computing the distance between a new data point (xxx) and every training point (xixi) using a distance function, typically the Euclidean distance. The k training points with the smallest distances become the ""neighbors"" used for prediction. For classification tasks, the class label most frequently represented among these neighbors is assigned to xxx; for regression, the average or weighted average of their target values is used.

The algorithm formalizes the prediction step as follows: compute the distance between xxx and the i-th training point (d(x, xi) = √(Σjjj (xjj - xiji)²)) and identify the k closest instances. The class label most frequently represented among these neighbors is then assigned to xxx for classification.
