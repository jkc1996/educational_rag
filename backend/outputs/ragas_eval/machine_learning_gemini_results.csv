4,What is instance-based learning in machine learning?,"['Instance-based learning, often called memory-based or lazy learning, contrasts with model-based approaches by not learning a global function or parameters during training. Instead, it stores the raw training examples and uses them directly at prediction time to estimate outputs for new queries based on their similarity to stored instances. This method assumes that similar inputs have similar outputs, making it highly flexible but sensitive to noise and outliers. It is computationally efficient during training but can be slow during prediction, especially for large datasets.']","Instance-based learning, also known as memory-based learning or lazy learning, is a machine learning paradigm that contrasts with model-based or eager approaches.  Instead of learning a global function from training data, it stores the raw training examples and uses them directly to make predictions for new queries.  Generalization is shifted from the training phase to the prediction phase. This allows it to adapt to irregular or locally varying data because each prediction uses the most relevant training examples.  The core idea is that similar problems have similar solutions;  nearby points in feature space should have similar outputs.  This makes it suitable for complex, nonlinear, or variable relationships that a single global model can't capture.  Instance-based methods produce flexible, non-parametric models, adapting closely to the observed data given enough examples. However, this flexibility makes them sensitive to noise, irrelevant features, and outliers, requiring careful feature selection and normalization.  Training is fast (simply storing data), but prediction can be slow as it requires comparing to many stored instances.  The k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithm is a prime example.  Instance-based learning is useful when interpretability and adaptability are important, or when new data constantly arrives, but less so for large or high-dimensional datasets.","Instance-based learning, also known as memory-based or lazy learning, is a machine learning approach where the algorithm stores the training data and makes predictions for new inputs by comparing them to stored examples, typically using similarity measures, without building an explicit model during training.",What is instance-based learning in machine learning?,"['Instance-based learning, often called memory-based or lazy learning, contrasts with model-based approaches by not learning a global function or parameters during training.
