      "Machine learning is categorized into four primary types based on the nature of the data and the learning process. Supervised learning involves learning from labeled datasets where each input is paired with a corresponding output, used in tasks like spam detection or house price prediction. Unsupervised learning focuses on finding patterns in unlabeled data, applicable to tasks like customer segmentation or topic modeling. Semi-supervised learning combines both labeled and unlabeled data, useful when labeled data is scarce. Reinforcement learning involves learning optimal actions through trial and error with feedback from rewards, commonly used in robotics or game playing."

      "Machine Learning can be broadly classified into four main categories: Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled datasets, where each input comes with a corresponding output (e.g. spam detection, house price prediction). Unsupervised Learning: Extracting patterns from unlabeled data, such as clustering or dimensionality reduction (e.g. customer segmentation, topic modeling). Semi-Supervised Learning: Using both labeled and unlabeled data, common when labeled data is scarce but unlabeled data is plentiful. Reinforcement Learning: Learning optimal actions through trial and error and receiving feedback via rewards (e.g. game playing, robotics)."
