Other Search Tools You Can Use with LangChain + Ollama
1. Google Search (SerpAPI)
Requires a free (limited) API key from serpapi.com

Much more powerful and up-to-date than DuckDuckGo.

Example LangChain integration: SerpAPIWrapper

2. Tavily
Tavily offers a developer-friendly, LLM-first web search API (free for light usage).

Also works well with LangChain via TavilySearchResults.

3. Bing Search API
Requires a Microsoft Azure/Bing API key.

LangChain has support via the Bing search tool.

4. Other Web Scrapers
If you want, you can even build your own simple search/scraper tool with Python (requests + BeautifulSoup) and pass the results to Ollama.
