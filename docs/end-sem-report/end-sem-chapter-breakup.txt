improved final RAGAS - evaluation:

Chapter 6 ‚Äî Evaluation & RAGAS-Based Benchmarking
‚úÖ 6.1 Introduction to RAGAS
A 2‚Äì3 paragraph overview explaining:

What RAGAS is and why it‚Äôs used for evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines.

How RAGAS splits evaluation into three categories:

Retrieval Metrics

Nvidia Metrics

Language Metrics

Description of the setup:

Multiple LLMs: Groq, Gemini, Ollama

Questions generated from educational content

Evaluated using ground-truths, response outputs

RAGAS outputs scores (0 to 1 or percentages)

Brief mention that evaluation includes:

Bar charts (averages),

Radar plots (LLM-wise profile),

Correlation heatmaps (metric behavior),

Drilldowns (per-question view)

üî∑ Now for each of 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 ‚Äî Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôll structure it:
‚úÖ 6.2 Retrieval Metrics
6.2.1 Metric Descriptions
For each metric, I‚Äôll provide:

Definition: What it measures

Goal: What a higher score means

Interpretation: How to read the numbers

Metrics under this:

Context Precision: % of retrieved chunks that are relevant

Context Recall: % of ground truth covered by retrieved context

Faithfulness: Whether the model‚Äôs answer stays grounded in the retrieved content

6.2.2 Visual Insights
Include and explain:

Bar Graph: Average values for all LLMs

Highlight best performer per metric

Radar Chart: Shape of performance

Comparison: Who is strongest overall in this category

Heatmap: Metric correlation insights

E.g., Faithfulness and Context Recall are highly correlated

Per-Question Drilldown (Optional): For 2-3 sample questions

6.2.3 Comparative Summary
Table or bullet-point:

Groq performs best in Precision

Gemini excels in Faithfulness

Ollama has lower consistency across all metrics

‚úÖ Final takeaway: Strengths of each LLM in retrieval.

‚úÖ 6.3 Nvidia Metrics
6.3.1 Metric Descriptions
NV Answer Accuracy: Direct match between answer and ground truth

NV Context Relevance: Does retrieved context help answer?

NV Response Groundedness: Does model stick to the context?

Each will have definition + how to interpret scores.

6.3.2 Visual Insights
Bar Chart: NV metric averages across LLMs

Radar Chart: Nvidia profile shape

Per-question drilldown: Interesting cases of grounded vs hallucinated

6.3.3 Comparative Summary
Gemini leads with highest groundedness and accuracy

Ollama struggles in consistency

Bar values like: Gemini (94.6%) vs Ollama (60.1%)

‚úÖ Final insight: Nvidia metrics highlight answer quality and hallucination resistance.

‚úÖ 6.4 Language Metrics
6.4.1 Metric Descriptions
We‚Äôll explain all major NLP evaluation metrics:

Factual Correctness (LLM judged)

Semantic Similarity (closeness in meaning)

Exact Match

BLEU / ROUGE Score

String Presence, Non-LLM String Similarity

Each explained with:

What it captures

Why it matters in educational QA

LLM-based vs string-based metrics

6.4.2 Visual Insights
Radar: LLM language quality profile

Bar Graphs: Semantic vs Exact Match comparisons

Heatmap: High correlations among language metrics (BLEU ‚Üî Semantic)

6.4.3 Comparative Summary
Gemini dominates language quality

Groq does well in BLEU and ROUGE

Ollama trails in string-based metrics

‚úÖ Takeaway: Gemini shines in linguistic fluency and correctness.
